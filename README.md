MTG Simulations

I am building this repository to provide simulation-based analysis of MTG deck construction. I will be grading decks by their simulation statistics and determining the best constitution under various conditions. As of now, the script 'deckbuilder.rb' "plays" a game of magic against an opponent who cannot cast spells. For simplicity, I am building the simulation with the following axioms:

1. Deck size is 60
2. Creatures' power and toughness are equal to their mana cost
3. All creatures have haste
4. All lands/creatures are the same color, and have only one color
5. All lands are basic
6. You always go first
